All my girls got daddy issues
They don't know what loving means
All my girls got daddy issues
But that ain't no issue too me, yeah

Her car's got six gears
She's got three years left in college
Holding back tears
Can't wreck that face filled with product
Tuition loan is blown on drugs
Busy taking photo bombs
Never trusted anyone
Cause daddy cheated on her mom

All my girls got daddy issues
They don't know what loving means
All my girls got daddy issues
But that ain't no issue too me, yeah

She's got three boys
To keep that inbox full of loving
Try and fill the void
Happiest when she feels nothing
Buy a bottle, go get drunk
Hit up every guy she's fucked
Ask 'em "why she ain't enough?"
Broken hearted way too young

All my girls got daddy issues
They don't know what loving means
All my girls got daddy issues
But that ain't no issue too me, yeah

No it ain't no, no it ain't no
No it ain't no issue too me
No it ain't no, no it ain't no
No it ain't no issue too me
No it ain't no, no it ain't no
No it ain't no issue too me
No it ain't no, no it ain't no
No it ain't no issue too me

All my girls got daddy issues
They don't know what loving means
All my girls got daddy issues
But that ain't no issue too me, yeah

All my girls got daddy issues, but
All my girls got daddy issues, but
All my girls got daddy issues, but
That ain't no issue too me, yeah (no issue too me)
