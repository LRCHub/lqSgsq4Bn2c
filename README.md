[00:23.97] Take you like a drug
[00:34.91] I taste you on my tongue
[00:46.91] 
[00:46.76] You ask me what I'm thinking about
[00:49.58] I tell you that I'm thinking about
[00:52.59] Whatever you're thinking about
[00:58.07] Tell me something that I'll forget
[01:00.80] And you might have to tell me again
[01:03.73] It's crazy what you'll do for a friend
[01:22.73] 
[01:07.31] Go ahead and cry, little girl
[01:10.01] Nobody does it like you do
[01:12.79] I know how much it matters to you
[01:15.50] I know that you got daddy issues
[01:18.55] And if you were my little girl
[01:21.15] I'd do whatever I could do
[01:24.05] I'd run away and hide with you
[01:27.05] I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too
[01:50.05] 
[01:31.58] I tried to write your name in the rain
[01:36.72] But the rain never came
[01:39.52] So I made with the sun
[01:42.73] The shade
[01:45.28] Always comes at the worst time
[02:00.28] 
[01:54.43] You ask me what I'm thinking about
[01:57.40] I tell you that I'm thinking about
[02:00.32] Whatever you're thinking about
[02:05.83] Tell me something that I'll forget
[02:08.78] And you might have to tell me again
[02:11.57] It's crazy what you'll do for a friend
[02:30.57] 
[02:15.15] Go ahead and cry, little girl
[02:17.89] Nobody does it like you do
[02:20.63] I know how much it matters to you
[02:23.57] I know that you got daddy issues
[02:26.46] And if you were my little girl
[02:29.05] I'd do whatever I could do
[02:31.93] I'd run away and hide with you
[02:34.75] I know that you got daddy issues
[02:50.75] 
[02:36.95] I keep on trying to let you go
[02:40.40] I'm dying to let you know
[02:43.26] How I'm getting on
[02:48.37] I didn't cry when you left at first
[02:51.51] But now that you're dead it hurts
[02:54.68] This time I gotta know
[02:57.45] Where did my daddy go?
[02:59.71] I'm not entirely here
[03:05.13] Half of me has disappeared
[03:18.13] 
[03:11.71] Go ahead and cry, little boy
[03:14.37] You know that your daddy did too
[03:17.19] You know what your mama went through
[03:20.39] You gotta let it out soon, just let it out
[03:41.39] 
[03:22.79] Go ahead and cry, little girl
[03:25.52] Nobody does it like you do
[03:28.43] I know how much it matters to you
[03:31.28] I know that you got daddy issues
[03:34.25] And if you were my little girl
[03:36.94] I'd do whatever I could do
[03:39.60] I'd run away and hide with you
[03:42.49] I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too
[04:05.49] 
[03:45.72] If you were my little girl
[03:48.08] I'd do whatever I could do
[03:50.95] I'd run away and hide with you
[03:53.62] I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too
